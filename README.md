This is the Stan Weinstein strategy, coded and backtested. The major indicators used are 30-week moving average, volume and relative strength. 
According to the strategy given by Weinstein, we go long when the price of the stock is above the moving average, and close the position or go
short when the price is below the moving average. There is a consolidation breakout when the price suddenly jumps (best time to go long), and it can be characterised by 
a abrupt influx in volume. We also plot the relative strength and go long only when the RS is greater than 0.
